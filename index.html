    <P id="W"><strong> 2020 is my third year in <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a>, and I have a great time
        in American, although I didn't have my family and old friends who accompanied me.
        it's my first photo in MSU,and I still remembered my first time to visit Michigan 
        State University, everything was so beautiful and fresh for me, on the other hand,
        I didn't get any comfortable feel at that time,although new enveriment was attracted
        to me a lot. In fact, my life was filled of loneliness until I met new friends. I believed 
        a lot of freshmen also met similiar questions. For me,friends takes an important part in my MSU
        memories, they not only brought me warm, but also taught me a lot. They let me know which dining
        hall is best, and they also took me to handle the phone card when I was a greenhand in American life.
        During MSU time, I think that my best benefit isn't knowledge in my memories, the real treasure is that I becaome a maturer
        and know how to live a unfamiliar place.
        Now I also become an experienced MSU student, I would share some great MSU areas in my memories, although 
         I didn't live in the school now.Each rank is my subjective opinion, no offical datas.</strong>
